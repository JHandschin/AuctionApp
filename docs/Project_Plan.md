# Auction App

Project Overview
------
This project aims to build a system for running an auction at a school or church activity.

The auction system will be for managing a live event, not running an online auction like e-bay. It aims to replace paper voting with a mobile phone system so that people can know what they’ve spent so far and will also help tally the results at the end of the night. The system will support both a silent auction and a live auction and be capable of running on a PC (for an administrator) and iOS and Android mobile devices.

Team Organization
------
The team consists of four Computer Science students currently attending Utah State University.  Each member of the team contributes their own unique style and experience that they have had in academic and professional programming.  

Since the whole team is on the same level, it will fit into a self-managing team style with one member of the team taking the lead during each of the four milestones.  Each member of the team will be accountable to each other member, and all members of the team expect each other member to contribute and carry their load.

Software Development Process
------
The development will be broken up into five phases.  Each phase will be a little like a Sprint in an Agile method and a little like an iteration in a Spiral process.  Specifically, each phase will be like a Sprint, in that work to be done will be organized into small tasks, placed into a “backlog”, and prioritized.   Then, using on time-box scheduling, the team will decide which tasks the phase (Sprint) will address.  The team will use a Scrum Board to keep track of tasks in the backlog, those that will be part of the current Sprint, those in progress, and those that are done.

Each phase will also be a little like an iteration in a Spiral process, in that each phase will include some risk analysis and that any development activity (requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, etc.) can be done during any phase.  Early phases will focus on understanding (requirements capture and analysis) and subsequent phases will focus on design and implementation.  Each phase will include a retrospective.

* Phase 1 - Requirements Capture
* Phase 2 - Analysis, Architectural, UI, and DB Design
* Phase 3 - Implementation, and Unit Testing
* Phase 4 - More Implementation and Testing 

We will use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to document user goals, structural concepts, component interactions, and behaviors.

Communication policies, procedures, and tools
------
We will continue using phones in a group text for all main communications.
We have planned to meet every Monday and Friday at 3:30 to keep up with each other.
We are all fairly familiar with git and it's operations to be competent in online-coordination.
We are also agreed to have all member accept a pull request before merging.
